On the new settings page:

Have a log in/sign up button if the user is not logged in.
Log out button if they are.

If the user is logged in, provide a menu.
One option there is to add a bunch of images to the game. 
I need an input area to choose the set's name.
I could let the user load an existing set so they can edit it.
Adding images -
Recycle the old textarea for this?
Or I could have input boxes - and an option to keep adding more - 
    and then by the side of these, a mini cell showing how that image could look/if it worked.
Also a delete tool - delete individual images or sets.

Submit button.
