React Creeper Game is live! Check it out at: https://react-creeper-game.web.app/

This is a flashcard game for helping students to practice languages.

Teachers can sign up and create and edit sets of flashcards using image URLs they find online.

The flashcards appear in a randomised grid, and students call out which cards they want to try.

Cards can be safe or explosive. 4 safe cards in a row wins the game.


Tech used is React, and Firestore. That's all!
I implemented a nifty hook to save things into the browser storage, check it out.
